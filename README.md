# Skipping project
Genome assembly problem is like skipping. Many many rounds, again and again.
# Current status
* Build kmer count as vertices (31-mer) (on ecoli) (&#8730;)
* Filter singleton kmer (&#8730;)
* Glue non-branching kmer path (&#8730;)
* Build (small k)-mer graph to early filter (big k)-mer (on fruit fly and even human) <-------------------- current
* Simplify the non-branching path graph
* ...
